# üîß Device Authorization Fix for TravelTurkey

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Successfully installed with compatible versions
‚úÖ **TypeScript**: Type checking working
‚úÖ **ESLint**: Linting configuration working
‚úÖ **Device Detected**: R5CXC2C3JPE connected
‚ùå **Authorization**: Device is unauthorized

## üì± Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Authorize USB Debugging

Your device `R5CXC2C3JPE` is connected but not authorized. Follow these steps:

1. **Check your phone screen** - You should see a popup asking:
   "Allow USB debugging?"
2. **If you see the popup:**

   - ‚úÖ Check "Always allow from this computer"
   - Tap "OK" or "Allow"

3. **If no popup appears:**
   - Disconnect and reconnect USB cable
   - Try different USB port
   - Make sure USB connection mode is set to "File Transfer" or "PTP"

### 2. Revoke and Re-authorize (if needed)

If still having issues:

```powershell
# Kill ADB server
adb kill-server

# Start fresh
adb start-server

# Check devices again
adb devices
```

### 3. Alternative: Clear ADB keys

If authorization keeps failing:

```powershell
# Clear stored keys
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.android\adbkey*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Restart ADB
adb kill-server
adb start-server

# Reconnect device (will prompt for authorization again)
adb devices
```

## üöÄ Once Authorized, Run Your App

After your device shows as "device" instead of "unauthorized":

```powershell
# Option 1: Use the custom script
.\run-on-device.ps1

# Option 2: Manual commands
npm start                        # Terminal 1: Start Metro
npx react-native run-android    # Terminal 2: Build and install
```

## üì± Expected Output After Authorization

```
List of devices attached
R5CXC2C3JPE    device
```

When you see "device" instead of "unauthorized", you're ready to proceed!
