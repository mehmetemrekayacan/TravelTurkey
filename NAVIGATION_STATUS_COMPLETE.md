## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### ✅ React Native Reanimated Module Resolution

  - Downgraded to stable version `react-native-reanimated@3.8.1`
  - Added proper Babel plugin configuration
  - Cleared Metro cache and rebuilt

### ✅ Configuration Applied

```javascript
// babel.config.js - Updated
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
  plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'], // Added for compatibility
};
```
